Functional Requirements
1. Mobile Application Framework
- Cross-platform compatibility (Android and iOS).
- Integration with an online database for data storage and synchronization.

2. Object Recognition and Description
- Real-time detection of common objects using the deviceâ€™s camera.
- Training using the Microsoft COCO dataset.
- Customizable categories (e.g., furniture, people, vehicles) for object detection.
- Audio feedback describing recognized objects.

3. Scene Description
- Contextual scene understanding (e.g., "You are in a park with trees and benches").
- Training using the Places365-Standard dataset.
- Audio feedback for scene descriptions.
- Activation via on-click (button press).

4. Text Recognition (OCR)
- Detect and extract text from images or live camera feed.
- Training using the SynthText dataset for English text recognition.
- Support for English language (minimum requirement).
- "Reading Mode" to capture documents/signs and read text aloud.

5. Safety Alerts
- Real-time detection of hazards (stairs, obstacles, moving vehicles).
- Training using the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite.
- Immediate audio warnings for detected hazards.

6. User Interface (UI)
- Simple navigation optimized for visually impaired users (large buttons, voice commands).
- Voice command support for app control.
- Onboarding tutorial to guide users through app features.

7. Real-Time vs. On-Click Functionality
- Real-time features:
- Object Recognition
- Safety Alerts
- On-click features:
- Scene Description
- Text Recognition

8. Documentation
- A1-sized poster detailing technical specifications, methodology, tools, and techniques.
- Brief user manual explaining app usage and features.

9. Data and Compliance
- Use licensed datasets (Microsoft COCO, Places365, SynthText, KITTI).
- Ensure compliance with data privacy and ethical regulations.

10. Additional Features (Optional but Encouraged)
- Implementation of innovative bonus features (e.g., multi-language OCR support, advanced hazard detection).
